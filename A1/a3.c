//Reason
/* If we wish to open a file, read a character, fork, and then have both parent and child process read the second character of the file independently.However, because both processes share a common file descriptor, one process might get the second character, and one might get the third. Furthermore, there is no guarantee the reads are atomic/non-atomic â€” the processes might get unpredictable results. */
